## Description
*A game to solve all your life's problems with! Consult the guru on any matter your heart desires and let him bestow wisdom upon you! Relive the Golden Age of text adventures! Beat the guru at his own game! So to speak!*

Released on 2 May 2011, GuruQuest was originally written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) and used [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/)(for sound) and [Eliza](http://codeanticode.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/eliza-library-for-processing/) (as the basis for the guru "A.I.").

However, times change and the applications for MacOS, Windows, and Linux back then no longer work (at least for me), so I've ported the code to JavaScript care of the lovely [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org) library.
