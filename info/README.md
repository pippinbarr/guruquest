## Description
Released on 2 May 2011, GuruQuest was originally written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) and used [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/)(for sound) and [Eliza](http://codeanticode.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/eliza-library-for-processing/) (as the basis for the guru "A.I.").

However, times change and the applications for MacOS, Windows, and Linux back then no longer work (at least for me), so I've ported the code to JavaScript care of the lovely [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org) library.

~~You can read [my writing about the game](https://www.pippinbarr.com/search.html?q=guruquest) on my website.~~

## Process
* [GuruQuest's code repository](https://www.github.com/pippinbarr/guruquest/) including the new (JavaScript) and old (Java) source code
